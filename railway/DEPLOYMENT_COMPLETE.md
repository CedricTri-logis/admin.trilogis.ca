## ⚠️ Required: Add Mews API Tokens

You need to add these two environment variables to the Mews service in Railway:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select the **mews-import-worker** service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add the following variables:

```bash
MEWS_CLIENT_TOKEN=<your_mews_client_token>
MEWS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_mews_access_token>
```

**After adding these, the service will automatically redeploy.**

## 🔧 Next Step: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel project dashboard and add these two environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_QUICKBOOKS_SYNC_URL=https://quickbooks-cdc-sync-production.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEWS_SYNC_URL=https://mews-import-worker-production.up.railway.app
```

**How to add in Vercel:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add both variables above

## 🧪 Testing

Once Vercel is updated and redeployed, test both integrations:

### Test QuickBooks:
1. Visit: https://admin.trilogis.ca/integration/quickbooks/import
2. Select companies
3. Start a sync job
4. Monitor real-time progress

### Test Mews:
1. Visit: https://admin.trilogis.ca/integration/mews/import
2. Configure date range
3. Start an import job
4. Monitor real-time progress

## 🏗️ Architecture

Both services run as **independent services** within the **same Railway project**:

✅ **Benefits:**
- Separate containers and processes
- Independent scaling
- Isolated logs and monitoring
- Separate domains
- Independent deployments
- Failure isolation (if one fails, the other continues)
- Easier to manage than separate projects

---

## 📊 Health Checks

Both services have health check endpoints:

- **QuickBooks:** https://quickbooks-cdc-sync-production.up.railway.app/health
- **Mews:** https://mews-import-worker-production.up.railway.app/health

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Once you:
1. ✅ Add Mews API tokens to Railway
2. ✅ Add both URLs to Vercel
3. ✅ Redeploy Vercel

Your integration will be fully operational with both QuickBooks and Mews workers running independently!
