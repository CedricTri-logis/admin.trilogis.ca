## üéØ What the Cron Job Does

1. **Runs on schedule** (e.g., 2 AM daily)
2. **Calculates date range** (yesterday's data)
3. **Calls Mews API** ‚Üí `POST /api/sync/start`
4. **Import starts** in background
5. **Cron exits** (job continues in worker)

### Change Time:

1. Go to **mews-daily-cron** service
2. **Settings** ‚Üí **Cron** section
3. Update **Cron Schedule**
4. Click **Save**

### Change Date Range:

Edit `railway/mews/cron.js`:

```javascript
// Current: imports yesterday's data
const yesterday = new Date();
yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);

// Change to: import last 7 days
const weekAgo = new Date();
weekAgo.setDate(weekAgo.getDate() - 7);

// Then update:
const from = weekAgo.toISOString().split('T')[0];
```

Commit and push - Railway auto-deploys!
