# ✅ QuickBooks Sync History & Cron - Complete

## What Was Added

### 1. Sync History UI ✅
**File**: `src/app/(landlord)/integration/quickbooks/import/page.tsx`

Added a "Historique des synchronisations" section showing:
- Last 10 QuickBooks syncs (manual or automatic)
- Sync status (completed, failed, running)
- Date/time of each sync
- Realm ID for each company
- Duration of sync
- Statistics (created, updated, deleted, errors)
- Error messages if sync failed

### 2. Daily Cron Job Script ✅
**File**: `railway/quickbooks/cron.js`

Automated script that:
- Runs on a schedule (e.g., daily at 2 AM)
- Fetches all active QuickBooks companies from Supabase
- Triggers CDC sync for each company with verification
- Logs detailed progress and results
- Exits with success/error code

### 3. Railway Configuration ✅
**Files**:
- `railway/quickbooks/railway.toml`
- `railway/quickbooks/railway.json`

Configuration to run the cron job with:
- `node cron.js` start command
- Restart on failure policy
- Proper build settings

### 4. Setup Documentation ✅
**File**: `railway/QUICKBOOKS_CRON_SETUP.md`

Complete guide with:
- Step-by-step Railway dashboard instructions
- Environment variable setup
- Troubleshooting tips
- Schedule options
- Expected log output

## Next Steps - Manual Railway Setup

Since Railway MCP can't create new services, you need to **manually create** the service in the Railway Dashboard (takes 2 minutes):

### Follow This Guide:
📖 **railway/QUICKBOOKS_CRON_SETUP.md**

### Quick Steps:
1. Open: https://railway.app/project/4b6312d5-289c-48a8-b9ca-575221127399
2. Create new service: **quickbooks-daily-cron**
3. Connect to repo: **CedricTri-logis/admin.trilogis.ca**
4. Set root directory: **railway/quickbooks**
5. Set cron schedule: **0 2 * * ***
6. Set start command: **node cron.js**
7. Add environment variables:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://lwtjrizdzrdzkzcwtgfj.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-key>
   RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=<quickbooks-cdc-sync-domain>
   ```
8. Deploy!

## How It Works

### Manual Sync Flow
1. User clicks "Démarrer la synchronisation" button
2. Frontend calls `/api/sync/start` for each company
3. Worker creates job and runs CDC sync
4. SSE streams real-time progress
5. History shows completed sync

### Automatic Cron Flow
1. Railway triggers cron at 2 AM daily
2. Cron script queries active companies
3. Sends sync request to worker API
4. Worker processes sync in background
5. History shows completed sync (same as manual)

### History Display
- Both manual and cron syncs appear in history
- Fetched from `/api/sync/jobs?limit=10` endpoint
- Shows last 10 syncs across all companies
- Real-time loading state
