# Vercel Environment Variables - Setup Complete

## ✅ Environment Variable Added Successfully

The Railway CDC Sync Worker URL has been added to your Vercel project across all environments.

### Variable Details

**Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL`
**Value:** `https://quickbooks-cdc-sync-production.up.railway.app`

### Environments Configured

✅ **Production** - Added 20 seconds ago
✅ **Preview** - Added 10 seconds ago
✅ **Development** - Added 9 seconds ago

## Verification

You can verify the environment variables anytime by running:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

Output shows:
```
name                        value               environments        created
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL    Encrypted           Development         9s ago
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL    Encrypted           Preview             10s ago
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL    Encrypted           Production          20s ago
```

## Using the Variable in Your Next.js App

The environment variable is now available in your Next.js application:

```typescript
const cdcSyncUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL;
// Value: https://quickbooks-cdc-sync-production.up.railway.app
```

## Next Deployment

Your next Vercel deployment will automatically use this environment variable. No additional configuration needed!

### To trigger a new deployment:

```bash
# Option 1: Push to git (automatic deployment)
git add .
git commit -m "Add CDC sync integration"
git push

# Option 2: Manual deployment
vercel --prod
```

## Testing the Integration

Once deployed, you can test the CDC sync functionality by:

1. Creating a sync UI component in your Next.js app
2. Using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL` to make API calls
3. Opening an SSE connection to stream real-time progress

Example API calls:

```javascript
// Start sync
const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL}/api/sync/start`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ realmId: '9130348651845276', verify: true })
});

const { jobId } = await response.json();

// Stream progress
const eventSource = new EventSource(
  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CDC_SYNC_URL}/api/sync/stream/${jobId}`
);

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Progress:', data);
};
```
